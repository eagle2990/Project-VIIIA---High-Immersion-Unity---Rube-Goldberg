# Project 8a: Rube Goldberg Challenge #

This is my take of the project Rube Goldberg Challenge

### Details ###

* Build ONLY for __HTC Vive__
* _ExampleScene_ was used for testing, so it should be avoided in the review.
* Unity 2017.1.0f3
* This repository uses Git-LFS so it's necessary to download it via
__`git clone https://github.com/eagle2990/Project-VIIIB---High-Immersion-Unity---Performance.git`__ as the current _Download ZIP_ DOES NOT support LFS.
* Enjoy and have fun
